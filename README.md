=============================================

Live at : https://g-h-0-s-t.github.io/Privacy_Policy_For_InstaProfileToPDF_Chrome_Plugin

**Last updated:** June 16, 2025

Introduction
------------

This Privacy Policy explains how the Instagram Profile Exporter browser extension ("the Extension") handles your information. This Extension is designed to respect your privacy and operates entirely client-side - no personal data is collected, stored, or transmitted to any external servers.

Data Collection
---------------

**The Extension does NOT collect, store, or transmit any personal information.** Specifically:

*   No account registration required
*   No usage data collected
*   No browsing history tracked
*   No personal information gathered
*   No data shared with third parties

How the Extension Works
-----------------------

All processing occurs locally in your browser:

1.  When you click the extension icon, it checks if you're on an Instagram profile page
2.  All data processing (profile scraping, PDF generation) happens in your browser
3.  The generated PDF remains on your device
4.  No data is transmitted over the network

Information Processing
----------------------

The Extension temporarily processes Instagram profile data **only when actively used**:

*   **Processed Data:** Public profile information (username, bio, images, posts count)
*   **Location:** Exclusively in your browser memory
*   **Retention:** Data is discarded immediately after PDF generation
*   **Scope:** Only processes data from the active Instagram tab

Permissions Justification
-------------------------

The Extension requests these browser permissions:

*   **activeTab:** To access the current Instagram tab when you click the extension icon
*   **scripting:** To inject PDF generation scripts into Instagram pages
*   **instagram.com host permission:** To enable functionality only on Instagram domains

Data Security
-------------

Since no data leaves your device:

*   There are no servers to secure
*   No transmission risks exist
*   All processing is confined to your browser session

Children's Privacy
------------------

This Extension does not collect any data from users of any age group.
